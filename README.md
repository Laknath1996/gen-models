# Description 

Course project for EN.553.741 Machine Learning II at JHU. This repo contains code for implementing Wasserstein GAN, variational autoencoder and denoising diffusion probabilistic models from scratch.

## Training metrics

* WGAN (with weight clipping) [1] trained on MNIST: [[logs]](https://wandb.ai/ashwin1996/wgan/runs/kfa382kb?nw=nwuserashwin1996)
